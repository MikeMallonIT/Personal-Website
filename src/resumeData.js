  "aboutMe":"I am a Chicagoland native that relocated to DFW in 2019. While studding IT infrastructure concepts in college, I built upon them on the job site. Telephony became my area of expertise post-graduation while administrating one of largest Cisco UC PBX environments in the country. My leadership skills were fine-tuned and remain proficient when I was appointed to be the team's Product Owner.",
  "aboutMeLineTwo":"As demand for infrastructure automation increased, so did my desire to code. I completed the SMU Full Stack Boot Camp in 2022 and leverage the knowledge I gained while driving automation at work; and when build websites like this one. As Product Owner, I help guide my agile team but believe a strong leader should focus on empowering their teams and get their hands dirty whenever possible.",
