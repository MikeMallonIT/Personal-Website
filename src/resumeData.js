  "aboutMe":"I am a Chicagoland native that relocated to DFW in 2019. While studying IT infrastructure concepts in college, I built upon them on the job site. Telephony became my area of expertise post-graduation while administering one of the largest Cisco UC PBX environments in the country. My leadership skills were fine-tuned and remain proficient, having been appointed to be the team's product owner.",
  "aboutMeLineTwo":"As demand for infrastructure automation increased, so did my desire to code. I completed the SMU Full Stack Boot Camp in 2022 and leverage the knowledge I gained while driving automation at work and when building websites like this one. As a product owner, I help guide my agile team, but I believe a strong leader should focus on empowering their teams and get their hands dirty whenever possible.",
